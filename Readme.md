## 1. References to at least two scientific papers that are related to your topic


## 2. A decision of a topic of your choice (see below for inspiration)

In this project I am to investigate **Graph Anomaly Detection** in Company Networks with the help of **Graph Neural Networks**.
Inspired by the big issue of Value-Added-Tax Fraid, not only causing financial losses in the 
It is assumed that alone in 2021 the EU alone, approx. 15 Mrd. Euros have been stolen by utilizing Value-Added-Tax Fraud-techniques. [*(Ott,2024)*](https://epub.jku.at/obvulihs/download/pdf/10500928)








## 3. A decision of which type of project you want to do (see below)
In this case I'll choose the *Bring Your Own Method*

# 4. A written summary that should contain:
- Short description of your project idea and the approach you intend to use 



- Description of the dataset you are about to use (or collect)



- A work-breakdown structure for the individual tasks with time estimates (hours or days) for dataset collection; designing and building an appropriate network; training and fine-tuning that network; building an application to present the results; writing the final report; preparing the presentation of your work.
