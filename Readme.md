# Setup
1. Setup the DB Infrastructure via `docker-compose up -d`.
2. Install all needed packages via `poetry install`.
3. Download the data from [IBM - Syntetic Transaction Data for Anti-Money-Laundry Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealtman2019/ibm-transactions-for-anti-money-laundering-aml/data) and store it in the `/data` dir.
4. Specify the data path in `src/data_insertion_to_neo4j.py` and run it via `python data_insertion_to_neo4j.py`.


# 1. Introduction
In this project I am investigating **Graph Structure-based Fraud Detection** in Financial Transaction Networks with the help of **Graph Neural Networks**.


Initially Inspired by the big issue of Value-Added-Tax Fraud, where in 2021 alone approx. 15 Mrd.â‚¬have been stolen by criminals applying Value-Added-Tax Fraud-techniques in the EU according to [*Ott (2024)*](https://epub.jku.at/obvulihs/download/pdf/10500928).
Due to lack of publically available data, I had to switch to something similar: Money Laundry Patterns in Transaction Networks. As I chose a geometry based approach, it might still be useful for VAT Fraud as well.


Therefore, I try to **bring my own method** to detect money laundering in the geometrical structures present in the IBM Transactions for Anti Money Laundering (AML) while orienting myself on the following three papers:
- [The geometry of suspicious money laundering activities in financial networks](https://perfilesycapacidades.javeriana.edu.co/en/publications/the-geometry-of-suspicious-money-laundering-activities-in-financi)
- [Provably Powerful Graph Neural Networks for Directed Multigraph](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.11586)
- [Smurf-based Anti-money Laundering in Time Evolving Transction Networks](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354487674_Smurf-Based_Anti-money_Laundering_in_Time-Evolving_Transaction_Networks)

For this purpose, I am using the following dataset:
-  [IBM - Syntetic Transaction Data for Anti-Money-Laundry Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealtman2019/ibm-transactions-for-anti-money-laundering-aml/data): 



This data looks the following and contains 180 Mio. of those transactions (rows), with a high and low Laundering-Transaction Share.
